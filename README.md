# sveltevis

A Svelte component library for composing responsive interactive data visualisations.

This package is in active development and is not yet ready for use. The first milestone is to develop the smallest set of fully-functional components needed to make a responsive, interactive scatterplot, using the project's approach to configuring component settings and managing state.

This project is targetting <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-december-2023">Svelte 5</a> and uses <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/runes">runes</a>. If you want to try the currently available components, or contribute to development:

1. Clone the repository from <a href="https://github.com/olihawkins/sveltevis">GitHub</a>

2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies

3. Run `npm run dev` to start the demo application on localhost:5173
